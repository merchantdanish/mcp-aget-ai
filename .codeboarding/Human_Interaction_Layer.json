  "description": "The `Human Interaction Layer` is a critical subsystem designed to facilitate seamless human-in-the-loop workflows within the AI agent framework. Its primary purpose is to enable agents to request information, receive feedback, and process responses from human users, thereby integrating human intelligence and decision-making into automated processes. This layer adheres to the project's architectural biases by promoting modularity, clear separation of concerns, and an asynchronous design, ensuring that human interactions do not block core agent operations.",

      "name": "Human Input Handler",
      "description": "This is the central orchestrator for managing human input. It's responsible for presenting prompts to the user, capturing their input (distinguishing between simple text and structured commands), and then parsing that input to determine the appropriate action for the agent. It also coordinates with the display mechanism to manage the visual state during input.",
