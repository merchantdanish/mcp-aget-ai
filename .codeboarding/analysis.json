  "description": "The `mcp-agent` project provides a robust framework for developing AI agents. At its core, the **Core Application & Setup** component initializes the entire system and manages configurations. The **Agent Execution & Workflow Engine** then takes over, orchestrating the execution of various **Agent Workflow Patterns** (like orchestration, routing, or parallel processing) which define the agent's high-level behaviors. These workflows, in turn, leverage the **Agent Core & LLM Integration** component to interact with Large Language Models and perform agent-specific actions. The **MCP Service Integration** component is crucial for discovering and connecting to external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, providing the necessary tools and resources to the agents. Finally, the **Human Interaction Layer** enables human-in-the-loop capabilities, allowing agents to request and receive input from users, which is then processed by the Execution Engine.",
