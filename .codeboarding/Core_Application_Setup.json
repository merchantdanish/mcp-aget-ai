  "description": "This component is the foundational layer of the `mcp-agent` application. It is responsible for the initial bootstrapping of the entire agent framework, establishing the global application context, and managing the loading, parsing, and provision of all application settings and sensitive information. It acts as the central orchestrator for the agent's environment, ensuring that all subsequent components operate with the correct parameters and have access to essential services. Its design emphasizes modularity and extensibility, crucial for an AI agent development framework.",
